# C-programming
Repository with random C code as part of practicing my craft.

# Why C?
It gets me very close to the bare metal of any device and I want to learn more about memory management.

# Setup
## For Windows Environments
I use Visual Studio Code because I don't need the overhead that VIsual Studio comes with. The steps included to build any file in this repositiry is as follows:
1. Open (or install and open) VS code and install the **Microsoft C/C++ Extension**.
2. Once this is complete, install the build tools either from the extensipon's link or the web installer included in this repository under **/tools/**
3. Open the developers command prompt in Windows and change directory to this repository root folder.
4. Type in **code .** to start Visual Studio code at that location.
5. Create run/debug config with VS code.
6. Build and run files.
